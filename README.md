## Notes

One of the challenges I encountered was trying to incorporate icons into the app. I was unaware that Xcode didn't automatically reformat the icons, so I have to do the resizing myself through trial and error or through dimensions retrieved online. Another issue was the loading screen——it took awhile for me to get use to the way Cocoapods operated.
